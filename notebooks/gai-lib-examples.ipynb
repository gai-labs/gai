      " Once upon a time, in a small village nestled at the foot of a mountain, there lived an old woman who had spent her entire life tending to her garden. She was known throughout the land for her beautiful flowers and lush vegetables, which she would sell at the local market every week. One day, as she was out picking her produce, she stumbled across a mysterious seed that she had never seen before. Without hesitation, she planted it in her garden and watched as it grew into the most magnificent tree she had ever seen. The tree bore fruit unlike any other, with juicy oranges that were filled with gold coins. The villagers were amazed by this newfound treasure and flocked to the old woman's house to get their share. From then on, the old woman became rich beyond her wildest dreams, all thanks to the magical seed she found in her garden.({'finish_reason': 'stop'}, 'finish_reason')\n",

      "In the heart of a bustling metropolis, there lived an odd-job man named Samuel who was notorious for his unfailing cheerfulness in the face of relentless hard work. One ordinary day, while he was hauling discarded artifacts from a nearby thrift shop, he chanced upon an ancient-looking lamp caked with years of dirt and neglect. Hoping to sell it for a few extra bucks, Samuel scrubbed the lamp clean and, to his stunned surprise, a vibrant genie materialized amidst a swirl of multicoloured mist! The genie granted him three wishes, but Samuel - forever content with what he had - humbly wished for happiness for everyone else, the welfare of strays and a beautiful home. His wishes granted, Samuel continued to live his life in the same way, yet left an indelible mark by unknowingly becoming the epicenter of happiness in his city.None\n",
